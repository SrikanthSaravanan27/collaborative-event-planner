# Collaborative Event Planning System

A backend-focused, real-world **Collaborative Event Planning System** built using **Spring Boot** with a strong emphasis on **clean architecture, security, system design principles, and scalability**.

This project is designed to simulate **industry-grade development practices**, including proper Git workflows, authentication & authorization, DTO usage, and future-ready architecture.

---

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Build a **production-style backend application**
- Apply **clean layered architecture**
- Implement **JWT-based authentication & role-based authorization**
- Practice **GitHub collaboration & branching strategies**
- Integrate **system design concepts** (scalability, caching, async processing)
- Prepare for **backend & system design interviews**

---

## 🧩 Core Features (Planned)

### 🔐 Authentication & Authorization
- User Registration & Login
- JWT Token-based Authentication
- Role-based Authorization (USER, ORGANIZER, ADMIN)
- Secure API access using Spring Security

### 📅 Event Management
- Create, update, delete events
- Invite collaborators to events
- Role-based access to event actions

### 👥 Collaboration
- Multiple users collaborating on a single event
- Permission-based actions
- Future-ready for notifications & async updates

### ⚙️ System Design Concepts
- DTO ↔ Entity separation
- Service-layer business logic
- Stateless authentication (JWT)
- Redis (Streams / Cache – learning purpose)
- Microservice-ready structure (future scope)
